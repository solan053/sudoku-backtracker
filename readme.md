To build the code and run it on a given file with a certain mode, use the command

make args="$file $mode" run


Here,
$file = filename (given in txt files) with extensions

$mode = Simulation mods 

    b - backtracking
    
    sa - simulated annealing, not yet implemented



Alternatively, you can just build the code with make and run using ./solver.
